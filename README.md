# Wizards Armarium

This mod is provided as a courtesy to allow obtaining the Wizards Armarium without Ars Nouveau or any other dependencies (except Curio).

It will not receive further updates since planed functionalities for the Armarium tie it closer to Ars Nouveau.

See [Ars Instrumentum](https://github.com/Sarenor/Ars-Instrumentum) for the complete mod with all functionalities.
